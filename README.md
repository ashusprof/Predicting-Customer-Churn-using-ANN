# ðŸ”„ Predicting Customer Churn using ANN

Welcome to this project where we use deep learning to predict **customer churn** based on user behavior and account data. This notebook builds an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using Keras to classify whether a customer will leave the service.

ðŸ§  **About the Project**

This project explores:

- Real-world customer data from a telecom company
- Encoding categorical data & feature scaling
- Building a fully connected ANN with Keras
- Training and evaluating a binary classifier
- Predicting churn on new data

ðŸ“ˆ Technologies Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
